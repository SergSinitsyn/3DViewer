# 3D Viewer
The 3D Viewer is a modern app written C++. The application provides viewing 3D wireframe models, loaded from .obj files and be viewable on the screen with the ability to rotate, scale and translate.

## Description
- The program is developed in C++17.
- The code follows the Google Style guide.
- Full unit test coverage is prepared using the GTest library for expression calculation modules.
- The graphical interface implementation is based on the Qt library.
- The program is implemented using the MVC pattern.

### Interface
- The program provide the ability to:
    - Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only).
    - Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes.
    - Rotate the model by a given angle in relation to its X, Y, Z axes.
    - Scale the model by a given value.
- The graphical user interface contains:
    - A button to select the model file and a field to output its name.
    - A visualisation area for the wireframe model.
    - Buttons and input fields for translating the model.
    - Buttons and input fields for rotating the model.
    - Buttons and input fields for scaling the model.
    - Information about the uploaded model - file name, number of vertices and edges.

### Settings

- The program allow customizing the type of projection (parallel and central)
- The program allow setting up the type (solid, dashed), color and thickness of the edges, display method (none, circle, square), color and size of the vertices
- The program allow choosing the background color
- Settings saved between program restarts

### Record

- The program allow saving the captured (rendered) images as bmp and jpeg files.
- The program allow recording small screencasts - the current custom affine transformation of the loaded object into gif-animation (640x480, 10fps, 5s) by a special button
